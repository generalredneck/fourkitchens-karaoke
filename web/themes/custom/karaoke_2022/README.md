# Karaoke Design

This is a temporary repo for the design work of the Karaoke app.

Questions? Ask Randy Oest in Slack.

## Details

This is an Emulsify repo. You can see the storybook by running `npm run develop`.

The fun stuff is in `/components`.

* This design uses [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/). See them for most of the details.
* `components/_vars.scss` is where you overwrite Bootstrap's default variables.
* Bootstrap's default variable list can be found at `node_modules/bootstrap/scss/_variables.scss`.

## TODO

* [] Design the header
* [] Design key pages
