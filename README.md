**How to Begin**
1. Clone this repo
2. `lando start`
3. ???? -> I personally got a `500 Internal Server Error` when I tried to click on the link that was delieved by lando. I tried:

1. `composer install` , `npm run rebuild` , `npm run build` ? -> I'd love to update this README with the steps to get set up.
